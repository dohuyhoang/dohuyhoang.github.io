<h1>OpenCloud vs VMware</h1>

<p>The most traditional technology for DC virtualization is VMware vCenter. Why I called it <em>traditional</em>. Because this tool has been developed for a long time, and was adopted by many legacy systems. However, we hardly called it Cloud technology. I have a honor to consult Mr. Thierry Carrez - OpenStack release manager. He gave me an answer that I found the most correct:</p>

<p><em>Traditional workloads run on servers that are like pets. They are
unique, you care for them, heal them when they are hurt, have HA in
place to make sure they survive etc.</em></p>

<p><em>Cloud servers are like cattle. They are generic, are set up
automatically using automation, and when they exhibit signs of failure
you shoot them.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>If your goal is to virtualize traditional workloads, you may find VMWare
offering more attractive, with nice HA / live migration features to
ensure the survival of your hand-crafted servers.</em></li>
<li><em>If your goal is more to heavily use automation, develops style deployments
and Amazon AWS like services, then OpenStack is the way to go.</em></li>
</ul>

<h1>Why not CloudStack?</h1>

<p>CloudStack is the top competitor of OpenStack in OpenCloud market now.</p>

<p>CloudStack is obvious much product oriented. I think <strong>OpenStack and CloudStack</strong> is similar to <strong>Windows vs Linux kernel</strong>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Although CloudStack is open-source, but recently report, Citrix contributes more than 50% to the project. </li>
<li>While OpenStack has Rackspace, IBM, HP, Redhat, Mirantis are top contributors, and dozen of companies contributes tiny parts. In addition, each platinum contributer has their own product-tested version based on core OpenStack.<br></li>
</ul>

<h1>OpenStack</h1>

<p>The concept is similar to Linux kernel and Linux distro: OpenStack is a framework (Linux kernel). Some of the companies in that ecosystem package the solution so that it&#39;s ready to use (Linux distro):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rackspace Private Cloud (Rackspace)</strong></li>
<li>Linux distributions like Red Hat or Ubuntu (Canonical) have offerings OpenStack package.</li>
<li>ENovance (France/Canada) </li>
<li>Cloudscaling (US) </li>
<li>Mirantis (US/Russia)</li>
<li>IBM (commercial version)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Rackspace Private Cloud</h1>

<p>Rackspace Private Cloud is an OpenStack configuration that has been developed, tested, and packaged by Rackspace OpenStack specialists. Offering that is easy to install, with a configuration that comes from our expertise in developing OpenStack clouds for our customers.</p>

<h4>Strength</h4>

<ul>
<li>Easy to install.</li>
<li>Well documented.</li>
<li>One deployment design (designed HA, networking, etc).</li>
<li>Based on latest release version of OpenStack (Havana)</li>
<li>Using Chef cookbook.</li>
<li>Central forum for discussion. Fast (free) support. </li>
<li>Rackspace is the company contributed the most for OpenStack recently.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weakness</h4>

<ul>
<li>Not flexible (must follow Rackspace deployment design).</li>
<li>Use latest OpenStack release version, not development version.</li>
<li>Lack of OpenStack new features (incubating projects). Not sure can we add them manually. </li>
<li>Not sure OpenStack third parties extension can work.</li>
</ul>
