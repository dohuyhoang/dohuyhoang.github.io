<p>In OpenStack neutron, there are two types of networks:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Provider network</strong>: simply speaking, it is a physical network inside (or between) your DCs. This network is shared between tenants. There are two way of config this network:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flat (untagged)</li>

<li>VLAN (tagged)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Tenant network</strong>: or virtual network inside connect each tenant. Of course, it is not shared between 2 tenant. However, two tenant network may connect to each other using a Neutron virtual router + L3 (Layer 3) agent. This type of network may be configed using:</p>

<ul>
<li>vlan (tagged)</li>

<li>gre (unique id)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
